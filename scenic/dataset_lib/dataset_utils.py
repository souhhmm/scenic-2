    # Each instance of the Dataset has three iterators, train_iter, valid_iter,
    # and test_iter, that yield a batch, where each batch is a (nested) dict of
    # numpy arrays. These iterators are created by normally applying these
    # functions on TFDS instances:
    #
    #  - dataset_utils.tf_to_numpy -> convert tensors to numpy arrays.
    #  - dataset_utils.maybe_pad_batch -> pad partial batches and create
    #   batch_mask if needed.
    #  - dataset_utils.shard_batches -> shard batch across devices by reshaping
    #   `[bs, ...]` to `[num_local_devices, bs/(num_local_devices), ...]`.
    #
    # Beside these iterators, there is a dictionary that stores the meta data
    # information about the dataset, that can be used for different purposes.
    # For instance, these fields are used in most of the datasets:
    #
    #   'input_shape': Used during compiling and initializing the model.
    #   'num_train_examples': Used for computing the number of training steps
    #      and controlling the train_iter.

    #   'num_test_examples': Same as num_train_examples, but for tes_iter.
    #   'target_is_onehot': Used in the loss and metric functions.

    # Note that each dataset can define it's own meta-data field that is used
    # in the model and/or the trainer, depending on the task. As an example, for
    # classification tasks, `num_classes` is used for the configuring head of

  All leave tensors in the batch pytree will be padded. This function expects
  the root structure of the batch pytree to be a dictionary and returns a
  dictionary with the same structure (and substructures), additionally with the
  key 'batch_mask' added to the root dict, with 1.0 indicating indices which are
  true data and 0.0 indicating a padded index. `batch_mask` will be used for
  calculating the weighted cross entropy, or weighted accuracy.

  Note that in this codebase, we assume we drop the last partial batch from the
  training set, so if the batch is from the training set (i.e. `train=True`),
  or when the batch is from the test/validation set, but it is a complete batch,
  we *modify* the batch dict by adding an array of ones as the `batch_mask` of
  all examples in the batch. Otherwise, we create a new dict that has the padded
  patch and its corresponding `batch_mask` array.

  Note that batch_mask can be also used as the label mask (not input mask), for
  task that are pixel/token level. This is simply done by applying the mask we
  make for padding the partial batches on top of the existing label mask.

  Args:
    batch: A dictionary containing a pytree. If `inputs_key` is not set, we use
      the first leave to get the current batch size. Otherwise, the tensor
      mapped with `inputs_key` at the root dictionary is used.
    train: if the batch is from the training data. In that case, we drop
      the last (incomplete) batch and thus don't do any padding.
    batch_size: All arrays in the dict will be padded to have first
      dimension equal to desired_batch_size.
    pixel_level: If True, this will create a pixel-level (instead of
      example-level) mask, e.g. for segmentation models.
    inputs_key: Indicating the key used for the input that we do batch padding
      based on.
    batch_dim: Batch dimension. The default is 0, but it can be different
      if a sharded batch is given.

  Returns:
    A dictionary mapping the same keys to the padded batches. Additionally we
    add a key representing weights, to indicate how the batch was padded.
